## Assumptions
    a. The ASCII Art Generator lives in one primary code repository.

## Directives
* Automated tests and infrastructure are important and sensitive. All changes must be reviewed and merged following existing protocols.
* Unit, Functional, and Performance tests live in the same repository with the functions they are testing. (See Assumption A above.) 
* All automated tests run with the same test runner and infrastructure that already exists for unit tests. (ie. Rspec, Mocha, Karma, JUnit, etc.)
* All automated tests run in continuous integration (ie. Jenkins, CircleCI, Bamboo, etc.)
